This project focuses Primarily on the use of HTML to create a webpage. We used data from a previous project about latitude and weather conditions. There are several contributing documents for this project including images, CSV files, Pandas DF (converted into HTML) and more. 
The main taks is to create a web page with navigation bars and links to filter through pages. We introduce users with a landing page that gives an introduction to the site with some visuals to support. 
The landing page has a navigation bar as well as hyperlinked images that can take the user to other pages.
There are 4 'visualization' pages that show data in the form of graphs and gives a summary of each specific latitude comparison. 
The 'comparisons' page shows all 4 of the visualization togther on the same page for users to view in unison. The images on this page are hyperlinked to take users to whichever specific visualization page they click on.
Lastly there is a 'Data' page that shows the data used in the graphs on other pages in table format so the user can easily compare information. This page, like all of the other pages, has a navigation bar that will allow the user to visit any of the other pages as well.
In addition to HTML coding there was a grat deal of research done to properly use programs like Bootstrap and Pandas to compile the information properly.
